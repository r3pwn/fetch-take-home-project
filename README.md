This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, we have to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

then we set the environment variables in the .env file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVICE_HOST=<your_service_host>
```

Then we can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
